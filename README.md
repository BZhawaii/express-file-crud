# Express CRUD with File Storage -- Books API

Write an Express app, that uses a file for persistent storage.

## Expectations

* Use ES6 wherever possible (e.g. `let`, `const`, destructuring and fat arrow functions)
* Make regular commits
  * Make a commit every time you complete a feature
  * Given each commit a meaningful commit message
