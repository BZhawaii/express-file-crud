# Express CRUD with File Storage -- Books API

Write an Express app, that uses a file for persistent storage.

## Expectations

* Use ES6 wherever possible (e.g. `let`, `const`, destructuring and fat arrow functions)
* Make regular commits
  * Make a commit every time you complete a feature
  * Give each commit a meaningful commit message
  * Don't expect the directions in this README to tell you went to commit
* All file operations must be asynchronous
* Your code must be perfectly indented.  If we can't read it, we aren't going to grade it.
* Work in your project directory at all times
